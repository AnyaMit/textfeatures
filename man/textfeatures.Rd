\usage{
textfeatures(x, sentiment = TRUE, word2vec = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Input data. Should be character vector, data frame, or grouped data
frame (grouped_df) with character variable of interest named "text". If
grouped_df is provided, then features will be averaged across all
observations for each group.}

\item{sentiment}{Logical, indicating whether to return sentiment analysis
featuresâ€“this includes \code{sent_afinn} and \code{sent_bing}. Defaults to
FALSE. Setting this to true will speed things up a bit.}

\item{word2vec}{Logical, indicating whether to return word2vec dimension
estimates. By default, this function will attempt to generate estimates for
anywhere from 3 to 300 word embeddings for each observation. Setting this
to FALSE will speed things up.}
}
\value{
A tibble data frame with extracted features as columns.
}
\description{
Extracts features from text vector.
